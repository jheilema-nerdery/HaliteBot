[x] create a 'crashy' bot that can collect some 255 squares and then crash
[ ] make sure my bot can account for crashy bots
[ ] check for the swap-places bug :/
[ ] don't waste strength on bad merges
[ ] sort peices by strength/prod ratios, then move only a % of them?
[ ] if there is a neutral piece between me & an enemy, wait.
[ ] early vs mid-game should be keyed off of making contact w/ an enemy.
[ ] early game: distance should be a stronger indicator
[ ] very early game: own spaces shouldn't affect interestingness (encourage merging)
[ ] very early game: enemy spaces should be a little more expensive

[ ] revisit overkill and attack strategies
[ ] identify valuable sites and then pathfind to them?
[ ] Machine learning, can it teach specifics about an algorythm? Weights of goal sites, most effective search areas, targeting enemies, how long should a piece wait until it moves?
[ ] watch comparisons between str/territory/production + enemies. Change strategy depending.
[ ] watch the speed of the map. Change strategy depending.
[ ] pathfinding
